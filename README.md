# AI Lead Scoring Service üöÄ

This project is an intelligent backend service designed to qualify and score sales leads. It accepts product information and a list of prospects (as a CSV), then uses a combination of rule-based logic and generative AI (Google Gemini) to assign a buying intent score (**High**, **Medium**, or **Low**) to each lead. The primary goal is to help sales teams save time by automatically prioritizing their outreach efforts.

    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    This command starts the container, maps the port, and securely passes your API key.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 -e GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE" lead-scorer-app
    ```
